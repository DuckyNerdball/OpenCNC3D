/*
 * lupdate.h -- "is there a newer build, and can you put it on this disk".
 *
 * THE SITE IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH. opencnc3d.com already has a Builds section,
 * and it is generated from three routes the launcher reads directly:
 *
 *   GET /api/builds                 the newest release and its assets
 *   GET /api/changelog              the changelog, entry by entry
 *   GET /api/download?asset=<id>    the zip, via a signed redirect
 *
 * So there is no separate publishing step and no key in the binary. The repo is
 * private and its release assets are not public; the site proxies them, which is
 * what lets a launcher on a player's machine reach a build without holding any
 * credential at all. Put a build on the site and every launcher offers it.
 *
 * The one thing the site does not publish is a checksum or a data fingerprint,
 * and lupdate.c's header says exactly what the launcher does about that.
 *
 * EVERYTHING SLOW RUNS ON A WORKER THREAD. The UI thread only ever reads the
 * phase, the progress and a copied-out string, so a stalled socket cannot freeze
 * the window: a launcher that stops repainting while it waits on a server is
 * indistinguishable from one that has crashed.
