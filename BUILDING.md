# Building OpenCNC3D

This repository is source. It contains no game data, so a fresh clone will compile but
will not run until you supply two things you already own.

## 1. What you have to bring

| | Where it goes | Why |
|---|---|---|
| A dump of your **European** C&C Nintendo 64 cartridge | `data/rom/cnc_eu.z64` | All 3D: models, textures, terrain, the camera |
| Your 1995 **MS-DOS** Command & Conquer discs | `data/dosdata/` | All 2D and all audio: sidebar, sprites, music, speech, movies |

Each of those directories has a README saying exactly which files are expected and,
for the movies, how to reconstruct the set. Read those first.

The EU cartridge specifically: it carries the Covert Operations missions, and every
offset in `docs/re-findings.md` is quoted against it. A US dump will not line up.

## 2. Prerequisites

**macOS**: Xcode command line tools, cmake and ninja, and Python 3 for the asset tools.
The Mac build is universal (Apple Silicon and Intel in one package, built on either), so
it links an SDL built for both rather than Homebrew's, which carries only the build
machine's CPU:

```
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake ninja
tools/mac/setup-sdl-mac.sh            # once: universal SDL3 + sdl2-compat, into ~/.opencnc3d-macsdk
```

The build scripts find that SDL by themselves. `OPENCNC3D_MAC_ARCHS=arm64` (or `x86_64`)
makes a quicker one-CPU development build; the play folder check then says it is not
universal, so it cannot be shipped by mistake.

**Windows**: the shipped binary is 32-bit, built with mingw-w64 i686. The 32-bit choice
is deliberate: the Remaster DLL casts a pointer through `unsigned int`, which is lossless
at 32 bits and truncates at 64. The scripts below drive that toolchain from a Unix shell,
which is also how CI builds it.

```
tools/win/setup-toolchain.sh          # once: fetches the two SDKs mingw-w64 lacks, into ~/.opencnc3d-winsdk
```

**Windows binaries from Linux**: the same scripts run unchanged on Ubuntu 24.04 with the
distribution's mingw-w64 packages. Two things the macOS path never meets: Ubuntu ships
the i686 compiler in a `win32` and a `posix` thread flavour and defaults to `win32`, while
Homebrew's mingw-w64, which the macOS path builds with, is `posix`, so point the
alternatives at `posix` to build what they build; and `setup-toolchain.sh` checks for the
x86_64 compiler as well, which the `mingw-w64` metapackage brings along.

```
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake mingw-w64 g++-mingw-w64-i686 python3-pil python3-numpy
sudo update-alternatives --set i686-w64-mingw32-gcc /usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-gcc-posix
sudo update-alternatives --set i686-w64-mingw32-g++ /usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-g++-posix
i686-w64-mingw32-g++ --version | head -1     # must end in -posix, not -win32
tools/win/setup-toolchain.sh
tools/win/build-win.sh                        # binaries land in build/win/
```

`tools/win/make-build-win.sh` is not part of this path: it packages the Windows binaries
with the data in `~/CNC3D/playable`, which only `game/make-build.sh` on macOS produces.
On Linux, stop at `build-win.sh` and copy `build/win/*.exe` and `*.dll` over an unzipped
release package to run them.

**Both** need Python 3 with `pillow` and `numpy` for the extraction and baking tools.

## 3. The brain

The game logic is EA's 2020 GPL release of Tiberian Dawn, unforked, with four additive
portability patches. It builds as a shared library the renderer loads at runtime.

```
tools/mac/build-brain-mac.sh          # -> TiberianDawn.dylib
tools/win/build-win.sh                # builds TiberianDawn.dll as part of the Windows build
```

`tools/check-brain-checkout.sh` verifies the checkout and the patches match byte for byte
before anything compiles.

The host looks for the library relative to the working directory. Override it with
`CNC_BRAIN=/path/to/TiberianDawn.dylib`.

## 4. Extracting and baking the data

With the cartridge in place, `tools/romdump/` decodes the archive and `tools/bakery/`
turns the result into the packs the renderer loads. **One step of that chain is missing
from this snapshot:** the PK4 pack baker is compiled bytecode whose source was lost and
is not published, so `tools/bakery/bake5.py` stops at its first import. See
`tools/bakery/README.md` for exactly what still runs and what does not. The `game/bake_*.py` scripts each own
one slice: sidebar, infantry, tiberium, campaign, effects, verdict screens.

These are the least documented part of the project and they were built to be run by
someone who already knew the pipeline. Start from `docs/re-findings.md` for the formats
and read the script you are about to run; each says at the top what it consumes and
produces.

Two environment variables are honoured throughout:

```
OPENCNC3D_ROOT      the repository root, when a tool is run from outside the tree
OPENCNC3D_ROM       the cartridge, when it is not at data/rom/cnc_eu.z64
```

## 5. The build

```
game/make-build.sh                    # macOS: renderer + app, into a playable folder
tools/win/make-build-win.sh           # Windows: a zip of the game, without the movies and music
tools/win/build-win.sh --no-brain     # skip the DLL, which changes rarely
```

`game/make-build.sh` takes the destination as its first argument and reads the baked data
from `OPENCNC3D_DATA`. The Windows zip expands to `OpenCNC3D-windows-<commit>/`, whose one
file to run is `OpenCNC3D.exe`, the launcher, and needs nothing installed on the target
machine.

The play folder `game/make-build.sh` makes keeps the 1995 movies and music, because the
gates that play a movie or measure the score run in it. The packages do not carry them:
`tools/mac/make-package-mac.sh` and the Windows packager leave out every path in
`tools/media/media-paths.txt`. A player gets them through the Windows installer or the
launcher's Setup screen, downloaded from disc images on archive.org: the movies from the
1995 Gold discs (EA's 2007 freeware release), the music from the Covert Operations disc
image. The game plays without them.

The SDL libraries are copied into the macOS build by `tools/bundle-sdl.sh`, which is
called with no file list on purpose so it scans the whole output folder. Skipping that
step produces a build that runs only on the machine that made it.

## 6. Two render tiers

Tier 2 is the modern desktop build, Windows and macOS, and may use shaders. Tier 1 is
the constrained one kept reachable as a stretch goal: Windows 98 on a 3dfx Voodoo 2
through Glide, fixed function, no shaders, no render targets, 640x480, 16-bit colour.

`docs/tier1-gap.md` is the contract between them. Any feature that cannot run on Tier 1
is listed there with its fallback. A Tier 2 feature that is not in that file is a bug,
because it turns a known list of compromises into a surprise.

The desktop presentation chain (bloom, ambient occlusion, sun shadows, colour grade, CRT)
is off unless asked for, so the default build draws the same picture on both tiers.

## 7. If it does not run

- **"Could not find the game"**: the executable resolves its own data directory relative
  to itself. It is looking for the baked packs, not the source tree.
- **Missing movies or music**: no package carries them. Tick them in Setup, or in the
  launcher's Settings (the gear button), and the launcher downloads them. In a development
  tree, the campaign names 72 `.VQA` files and they are split across both 1995 discs; see
  `data/dosdata/README.md`.
- **A tool cannot find the ROM**: set `OPENCNC3D_ROM`. Nothing hardcodes a path any more, and
  anything that appears to is a bug worth reporting.
